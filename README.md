## Introduction

This library can currently format and validate postcodes for the following countries:

- `CZ` Czechia
- `FR` France
- `GB` United Kingdom
- `PL` Poland
- `RE` RÃ©union island
- `SK` Slovakia
- `US` United States

Contributions are welcome: feel free to open a pull request to add a formatter for another country.

## Installation

This library is installable via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). Just run:

```bash
composer require brick/postcode
```

or manually define the following requirement in your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "brick/postcode": "0.1.*"
    }
}
```

## Requirements

This library requires PHP 7.1 or later.

## Project status & release process

This library is under development.

The current releases are numbered `0.x.y`. When a non-breaking change is introduced (adding new methods, optimizing existing code, etc.), `y` is incremented.

**When a breaking change is introduced, a new `0.x` version cycle is always started.**

It is therefore safe to lock your project to a given release cycle, such as `0.1.*`.

If you need to upgrade to a newer release cycle, check the [release history](https://github.com/brick/postcode/releases) for a list of changes introduced by each further `0.x.0` version.

## Quick start

```php
use Brick\Postcode\PostcodeFormatter;

$formatter = new PostcodeFormatter();

$formatter->isValidPostcode('GB', 'ABCDEFG'); // false
$formatter->isValidPostcode('GB', 'WC2E9RZ'); // true

$formatter->format('GB', 'WC2E9RZ'); // WC2E 9RZ
$formatter->format('US', '337014313'); // 33701-4313
```

Calling `format()` with an invalid postcode throws an [InvalidPostcodeException](https://github.com/brick/postcode/blob/master/src/InvalidPostcodeException.php).

Calling `isValidPostcode()` or `format()` with an unknown country code throws an [UnknownCountryException](https://github.com/brick/postcode/blob/master/src/UnknownCountryException.php).
